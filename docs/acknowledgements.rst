We would like to thank Egidio Landi Degl’Innocenti and Marco Landolfi
for sharing with us their deep knowledge on the physics of the spectral
line polarization, which they have described in great detail in their
rigorous monograph on “Polarization in Spectral Lines". Financial
support was provided by the AYA2007-63881, AYA2010-18029 and AYA2014-60476-P projects
of the Spanish MICINN and MINECO.
