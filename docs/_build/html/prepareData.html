<h1>Data preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Some data preprocessing has to be done in order to have reliable inversions with
Hazel. The process takes the following steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Data normalization</strong>: the data has to be normalized to the local continuum. This
is sometimes slightly difficult because the nearby Si I line has strong wings and one should
use that pseudocontinuum. The very first step would be to remove large scale variations
of the continuum, so that it is as flat as possible (perhaps removing fringes if you have
any). Then, you proceed to remove the influence
of the Si I line. What our people typically use is to fit the Si I line using
almost all its blue wing and only part of the red wing. I guess you can do it using
an inversion code like SIR or use a Voigt function. You probably want to get photospheric
information from your observations, so maybe SIR is a better option. Once you have
the Si I line fitted, just extend the synthetic wing towards the He I line and then normalize
the spectrum by the synthetic profile. This way, you&#8217;ll have the He I triplet correctly
normalized.
If the data is off-limb, things are typically easier because there is no continuum but
sometimes there is some stray-light that can give you a headache. In this case,
the input should be normalized by the peak emission.</li>
<li><strong>Wavelength calibration</strong>: the data has to be wavelength calibrated. How to do it depends
on whether you want an absolute calibration of velocities or not. If you want such absolute scale, the best is to do the wavelength
calibration using telluric lines and then transform everything to the Sun using the relative
velocity between the observed region and the Earth. If not, maybe using some weak
surrounding photospheric lines is enough. Note that all wavelengths are given with respect
to the center of the multiplet, which is 10829.0911 Angstrom for the 10830 Angstrom one)</li>
<li><strong>Computation of the boundary condition and heliocentric angle</strong>: every pixel should be labeled with its heliocentric angle (this is important for
observations close to the limb, where mu is changing fast) and its boundary condition.
So, you need to get a map of heliocentric angles together with your map of observed Stokes
profiles. Concerning the boundary condition, it is enough to compute the ratio between
the continuum intensity at every pixel and the average at the same heliocentric angle.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation of the reference system</strong>: it is important to understand which is the reference direction for positive Stokes
Q in the observations. Note that the output of the code depends on the <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> angle, which exactly
defines this positive Q direction. Two possibilities appear. The first one is to set <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> in the code
so that you understand which is the reference direction in the code and then rotate the Stokes Q and U data
so that the reference direction for Stokes Q is aligned with that of the code. The second possibility is to
keep the data as it is and then put the appropriate value of <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> in the code to make both reference
directions equal. This is usually not difficult, but it requires to understand which is the reference direction
for the telescope, which is sometimes difficult to get. It is always a good advice to have the scattering
geometry in mind and try to adapt it to your observations. See <span class="xref std std-ref">image_geometry</span> for more information.</li>
