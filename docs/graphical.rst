Graphical front-end
===================

Synthesis
---------

A graphical frontend is available after installation. Just type the following in a console:

::

    hazelgui

and if you have the dependencies installed, a graphical user interface for synthesis
should appear. This GUI is very useful to get used to how the line behaves and
to do inversion-by-hands. You can load files with the observations in 1D format. Just
click on "Load observation" and two dialog windows will appear. In the first one, select
the 1D file with the Stokes parameter. In the next one, choose the associated wavelength
file.
