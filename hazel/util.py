    Notes
    ----- 
        A rational approximation to the complex error function is used
        after Hui, Armstrong, and Wray(1978, JQSRT 19, 509). H and F are 
        the real and imaginary parts of such function, respectively.
        The procedure is inspired on that in SIR (Ruiz Cobo & del Toro 
        Iniesta 1992, ApJ 398, 385). On its turn, that routine was taken
        from modifications by A. Wittmann (1986) to modifications by S.K.
        Solanki (1985) to an original FORTRAN routine written by J.W. Harvey
        and A. Nordlund.
