Hazel
=====

Hazel (an acronym for HAnle and ZEeman Light) is a computer program for the synthesis and inversion of Stokes profiles caused by the
joint action of atomic level polarization and the Hanle and Zeeman effects. It is
based on the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which takes into account
rigorously all the relevant physical mechanisms and ingredients: optical pumping,
atomic level polarization, level crossings and repulsions, Zeeman, Paschen-Back and
Hanle effects. The code is written in standard Fortran 90. Its parameters 
are passed using four configuration files that can be manually edited. These
configuration files are heavily commented, so that their edition should 
be an easy task. In any case, two front-ends coded in IDL are given as a part of the 
distribution in order to facilitate a user-friendly execution of the program.
A parallel version of the code using Message Passing Interface (MPI) is
also available as well as a Python wrapper.
