 - GUI for analysis of inversions and synthesis of models

 - Quasi-Newton methods

 - Sparse regularization of maps

 - Regularization of parameters

 - In synthesis, all atmospheres have to have the same number of pixels
 - In inversion, we can use 1D models for the atmospheres and the number of
   pixels is controlled by the observations
 - Add input parameters (geometry, boundary, etc.) for inversions. Separate Stokes parameters
   from the rest of parameters.
