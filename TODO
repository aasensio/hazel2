 - Coupling of parameters
 - Quasi-Newton methods

 - Sparse regularization of maps

 - Regularization of parameters

 - In synthesis, all atmospheres have to have the same number of pixels
 
 - In inversion, we can use 1D models for the atmospheres and the number of
   pixels is controlled by the observations

 - Separate Stokes parameters from the rest of parameters. ???
