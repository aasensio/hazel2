   r_i = (data-model) / sigma

   bic = N*log(chi2/N) + ln(N) * Nvar

 - Sparse regularization of maps : change order of loops -> 1 LM (x,y) -> regularization
 - Regularization of parameters
 - In synthesis, all atmospheres have to have the same number of pixels

 - Add utilities for generating new SIR models
 - Show an example for inverting a random distribution of points to be inverted and then
   start from an interpolation of these maps to be closer to the solution
 - Develop tools to easily manage input/output models so that multiinversions are easy to do.
 - Check that output and input models are compatible so that reinversions can be easily done
 - Precalculate coefficients for the emission/absorption coefficients using sparse
   matrices and use them later on the calculation. This will avoid many of the loops
   that are, by construction, zero.
 - Programmatic inversions
